Indivisible teams are organized around specific issues such as healthcare, elections, or criminal justice reform. Team members plan events and actions and bring in the entire Indivisible Berkeley community to participate. Any community member is welcome to attend a team event or action. All of the team's contact information is on the corresponding team page. To join a team, do one of these three things:

1. Subscribe to the team mailing list and/or Slack channel to see what the team is working on right now

2. Email the team leaders using at teamname+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org to find out how you can help

3. RSVP to and show up at a team event or team meeting to begin helping out right away!
