Indivisible Berkeley members have knocked on over **13,000 doors** to help Democrats regain control of Congress since spring 2017. Our canvassing program is strong thanks to our canvassing captains, Billy, Jeff, Lynn and Cheryl.

Thank you to all of our canvassers for your hard work and dedication!
