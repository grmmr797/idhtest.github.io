Indivisible Berkeley community members travel to cities in California's 10th Congressional District Once or twice each month to talk to voters about the issues that are important to them, and to register new voters.

We have already had over 100 productive conversations and have registered over 50 people to vote!

We always partner with a local organization to make sure we respect the communities we visit.

For more information on canvassing, contact us at info@indivisibleberkeley.org or check out our upcoming events tagged "canvassing."
