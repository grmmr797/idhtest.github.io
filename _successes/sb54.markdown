The Indivisible Berkeley Immigration Team participated in "ICE Out of California Coalition" actions to help pass SB54 in our State Legislature. Team members went to rallies in Sacramento, lobbied our own state legislators, and even phone banked to other Northern California locations like Vacaville, represented by one of the key swing votes in the State Senate.

SB54 would require local and state law enforcement to only cooperate with ICE when legally required. The passage of this law is a big step towards keeping families together in California.
