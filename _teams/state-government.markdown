MISSION: TO PARTNER WITH THE HAWAII STATE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY DO IT
Background:  The Leg considers 3000-4000 bills each year.  There are duplicate bills between the House and Senate.   There are duplicate bills within the House and Senate.  Even if the bills are reduced by 50%, no one reads 1500-2000 bills per year.  The bills that are passed or killed each year are traded behind closed doors.  We need to reduce redundancy, improve transparency and accountability, and vote out the dead wood.
1)	State Legislature
a.	transparency and accountability
i.	gut and replace: 
1.	support Common Cause, League of Women Voters, and Civil Beat in lawsuit appeal
2.	partner with Senator Laura Thielen, Common Cause, and League of Women Voters to introduce bill abolishing gut and replace practice and providing alternate procedure to meet the alleged need for last-minute legislation
ii.	transparency: partner with Senator Jarrett Keohokalole to introduce bill providing teleconferencing of hearings so other islands can join, recording all hearings, making them freely available 24/7 so people who work during the day can view, and allowing 24 hours after hearing for late submission of testimony from those who were unable to attend in person
iii.	accountability: create tracking database on select bills incl voting records of individual legislators.  Pressure those voting “aye with reservations” to state their reservations on the record.
iv.	publicity: publish voting records on social media and partner with mainstream media to publicize voting records and egregious backroom dealing, especially during floor votes in the final 10 days of the session
b.	Communication: Encourage House and Senate to communicate internally and with each other to eliminate redundant bills (50%), encourage state and federal officials to work together on areas of common concern
c.	Oversight: encourage oversight of executive branch incl gov office and all state agencies 
d.	Focus topics: Identify 3 primary areas of focus (criminal justice reform, voting/elections, environment and land use incl land/air/water use incl development, zoning incl AirB&B and helicopters, climate change, affordable housing and homelessness incl rent control, education incl funding, healthcare incl abortion and mental health, Concon, taxes, $15 minimum wage)
