### Our Team

Big Ideas & Research is the internal team that:

> Provides a space for big ideas that are out of the box to be discussed, supported, and piloted (if a match).  We test new direct-action tactics which might be replicable and seek creative messaging opportunities.  Our Calendar and research capability support the IB community. Members have some specific interests in Labor partnerships, youth voter engagement and healthcare.
